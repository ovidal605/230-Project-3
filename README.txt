REQUIRMENTS
1) Include a Makefile that compiles your submitted code.

2) Include both C source files and header files. You can decide how best to organize your code and determine how many source and header files you require.

3) have good code organization using source and header files, functions, comments, and proper indentation.

4) include a README.txt file that provides an overview of how your code is structured, which parts of your code demonstrate a rubric item, and any other useful information that will help the reviewer understand your code.

5) compile a program that will accept 0 to n command line arguments. If your program receives 0 command line arguments it will read from standard input (using the bash pipe operator) for analysis. If your program receives 1 to n command line arguments it will open the provided files for analysis.

6) compile a program that will use a specified WORD_FREAK environment variable to parse and analyze a text file and produce the proper output.  

7) use dynamic allocation and freeing (e.g., malloc(), free()).

8) use structs and typedef.
